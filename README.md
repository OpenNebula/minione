# miniONE

**miniONE** is an easy to use deployment tool to build an evaluation OpenNebula cloud based on either virtual machines (KVM) or system containers (LXD). All necessary components to manage and run the virtual machines or containers are installed and configured on your dedicated system with just a single command run.

## Requirements

Common min. requirements:
- 4 GiB RAM
- 20 GiB free space on disk
- default installation of the operating system with the latest updates
- privileged user access (`root`)
- openssh-server package installed

For **KVM evaluation** on a dedicated physical server for both the front-end and one KVM hypervisor node:
- physical host
- x86-64 Intel or AMD processor with **virt. capabilities**
- operating system:
  - CentOS 7 (RHEL 7)
  - Debian 9
  - Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04

For **LXD evaluation** on a dedicated physical server or virtual machine for both the front-end and one LXD hypervisor node:
- physical host or virtual machine (e.g., Amazon EC2 VM)
- x86-64 Intel or AMD processor
- operating system:
  - Ubuntu 18.04

For **Edge evaluation** on a dedicated physical server or virtual machine for the front-end and one remote Packet edge physical server for one KVM hypervisor node:
- physical host or virtual machine (e.g., Amazon EC2 VM)
- x86-64 Intel or AMD processor
- operating system:
  - CentOS 7 (RHEL 7)
  - Debian 9
  - Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04

## Quickstart

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione/releases/latest) of the **miniONE** tool, run it and follow the instructions on the terminal.

### Get KVM cloud

Run the commands to deploy the evaluation cloud:

```
wget 'https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione/releases/latest/download/minione'
sudo bash minione
```

### Get LXD cloud

Run the commands to deploy the evaluation cloud:

```
wget 'https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione/releases/latest/download/minione'
sudo bash minione --lxd
```

### Get Edge cloud on Packet

Run the commands to deploy the evaluation cloud:

```
wget 'https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione/releases/latest/download/minione'
sudo bash minione --edge packet --edge-packet-token [packet-token] --edge-packet-project [packet-project]
```

MiniONE will install OpenNebula frontend on the host where you run the command and also configure one host one the Edge (Packet in this case) where you can spawn your VMs.
