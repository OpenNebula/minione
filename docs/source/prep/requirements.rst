For KVM evaluation on a dedicated physical server for the front-end and one KVM hypervisor node the minimal requirements are:

* x86-64 Intel or AMD processor with **virt. capabilities**
* physical host or virtual machine supporting the nested virtualization
* operating system: CentOS 7, Debian 9, Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04

* x86-64 Intel or AMD processor
* physical host or virtual machine
* operating system: Ubuntu 18.04

Edge deployment + KVM on Packet
===============================

For Edge evaluation on a dedicated physical server or virtual machine for the front-end and one remote Packet edge physical server for one KVM hypervisor node the minimal requirements are


for the frontend


* x86-64 Intel or AMD processor
* physical host or virtual machine
* operating system: CentOS 7, Debian 9, Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04

for the hypervisor(s) on Packet

* Packet API token
* Packet API project

The deployment process with the `miniONE <https://github.com/OpenNebula/minione>`_ tool is so quick and easy, that you can switch to the new machine at any time your existing one doesn't fit anymore.
